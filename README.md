#Tomy Tutor Play Computer OS v1.0
##What?
You remember the Tomy Tutor Toy Computer, it was a child's toy from the 80s. It was an entirely mechanical device that looked like any clunky old computer of the time.

##Why?
Because I saw one online and was taken with the notion of putting a real computer in one. I couldn't very well get away with doing that without having some nod to the original aesthetic so I decided to recreate the scenes from the little roll with the pictures on.
###But it's not a real OS
That's right, it's just a little bit of fun. You're probably running it on some giant behmoth of a machine anyway. It's meant for a Raspberry Pi 2 housed in a broken baby's toy.
###The fonts aren't right...
I know, I know. I've plumped for Helvetica Black and Bariol Bold as the closest matches for now. They're not free but it's a fairly mundane task to go and find modern alternatives.
###Python though...
I wanted to have a go. I spend all my time in javascript so I wanted to have a crack at something else.
##Thanks
This wouldn't have been possible (well it would have been but it would been an absolutely enormous *pita) without (http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame "PyGame") and (https://github.com/cosmologicon/pygame-text "PyGameText").
You'll need both of them to make this run on your own machine.
